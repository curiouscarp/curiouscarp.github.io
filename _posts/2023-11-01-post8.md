This will be a longer post and is a culmination of a few months worth of research. 


### Corporate Sector

I have been trying to learn more about corporate debt. Banerjee and Hofmann explain the rise in the share of zombie firms as negatively correlated with short-term nominal (and real) rates. 
Their findings with respect to bank price-to-book ratios as a reflection of bank health suggest a more episodic link associated in times of financial stress. While both the broad (persistent lack of profitability) and narrow measures (Tobin’s q) of zombie firms have increased significantly since the 1990s, it is worth noting that such a trend as explained by the linear regressions might not capture the leverage dynamics over the same period.

In an interesting policy brief by He and Sun, one can observe that debt to fixed assets and debt to tangible assets exhibit a similar trend in the time series. The gap emerging in the 1990s may have marked a turning point highlighting the emerging prominence of intellectual property such as software (1). 
Corporate leverage ratios dropped between 1990 and 2000 as measured by debt to capital and again between 2000 and the GFC as measured by debt to book value. 
The GFC might have been a “turning point for corporate borrowing as leverage ratios began to rise past levels last seen in the 1990s with leverage measured by book value reaching an all-time high of 69 percent in 2020” (1). The result aligns with the paper from Banerjee and Hoffman in the episodic role of weak banks. 
I am still learning about how different leverage ratios might relate to other measures of net corporate leverage.

### Bond Market

Financial conditions have been tightening as evidenced by the recent bond sell offs on the longer end (see Figure 6). 
Moreover, the 10-year was at 3.7%, and now it is around 4.7%. Despite the fed and banks not absorbing duration, a lot of the tightening on the long end was avoided earlier in the year via the reverse repo facility to deal with the T-bill issuance for the TGA drawdown, and lower term premiums. Thus, there might have been some excess cash to soak up duration.
However, to continue financing the large deficit, the treasury may issue more long-term debt to satisfy the acceptable range of T-bills as a percentage of the debt outstanding. 
Issues (currency) arise from having to roll over too much debt too quickly and the government may play catch up on net issuance. 
I wonder the extent to which investment funds are short treasuries. I also think it would be interesting to consider how an economic slowdown might affect the Fed’s QT path.

### Introduction to the Public Sector 

Several prominent investors have addressed the growing concerns regarding the vulnerability of the US dollar, which could potentially result in currency devaluation over the next few years. 
This presents a noteworthy macroeconomic development, as the United States, with the dollar as its reserve currency, has traditionally enjoyed the privilege of being able to print it without restraint. 
Nonetheless, it is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has played a significant role in undermining the financial stability of many nations, including the United States (Chancellor, Druckenmiller, Burry, Rickards, Schiff, etc). 

### Background

Let us consider the various methods through which the government works to stimulate an economy. “MP1” (monetary policy 1) is a reduction of interest rates. There exists a zero lower bound (ZLB) since cash has a nominal interest rate of 0 (liquidity trap). When MP1 doesn’t work governments utilize “MP2” which includes QE (1), artificially lowering yield and perhaps mispricing risk. The BOJ first introduced this method of economic stimulation in 2001. Such actions also widen the wealth gap as seen in the last decade, since people holding such assets are generally well off. To help borrowers, a government can pursue a third type of monetary policy, “MP3”. I partially explored this method in the Macro Discussion post. 

History is replete with currency crises like Thailand in 1997, Latin America in the 1980s, or the 1998 Russian financial crisis (á la LTCM). One can also study the downfall of the Roman Empire. Such problems tend to happen in countries that are reliant on capital inflows, so a large portion of the debts are denominated in foreign currencies. The effects of currency devaluations are severe and may include much higher import costs, a large GDP gap, and banking crises. Devaluations can stem from capital flight. This might be caused by a concern about the real return on the government debt from a supply/demand imbalance, tighter monetary policies abroad, or geopolitical/economic concerns. 

In Thailand, a strong reliance on foreign capital flows led to a high share of foreign debt as a percentage of GDP (51% by the mid 90s). The hot money fueled a leveraged bubble (not all that different from foreign buyers of U.S. debt pumping our markets) which spread to Malaysia and Indonesia. The current account deficit ballooned as individuals were long the baht through consumption channels. As asset prices at the peak of the bubble neared a Minsky moment, the economy was vulnerable to capital flight. A balance of payments crisis emerged by 1996 and a credit crunch ensued.

To defend its currency the Bank of Thailand (BOT) drew down foreign exchange reserves to buy baht. Of course, this was unsustainable as there (usually) exists a finite amount of the reserves. Another solution is to increase interest rates. This may also be unsustainable as higher interest rates slow an economy as borrowing becomes more expensive and fixed income assets lose value. Moreover, larger currency devaluations over shorter periods of time require exponentially higher annualized interest rates to defend. To avoid spending down reserves or too high interest rates a currency is eventually devalued. 

Geopolitics may have played an important role in the Thai crisis. For example, a large portion of foreign capital to Asia may have flowed through Hong Kong. The handover of Hong Kong marked the end of the 156-year British rule (3). Macau followed Hong Kong’s footsteps shortly thereafter. While the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration laid a framework for the transfer of Hong Kong to China under “one country, two systems,” one might wonder about the extent to which it affected capital flows (or expectations). Interestingly, the Baht devaluation occurred on July 2nd, 1997, just a day after the handover of Hong Kong. 

Figure 8: The Tom Yam Kung crisis led to a collapse in the baht after the government tried defending its dollar peg.

Soros made some money shorting the Baht by taking out forward contracts at 26 baht per dollar in 1998. When the Baht went from 25 per dollar to 54 per dollar, he traded $1 billion USD for $54 billion Baht then used the forward contracts with the locked in exchange rate to double his money to $2 billion dollars. There is another famous story with the bank of England in 1992. 

The consequences were severe for Thailand including the resignation of the prime minster, 64% of finance and securities companies shut down, the takeover of 27% of Thai banks, a lending contraction, and threats to the democracy (4). Notably, Thailand and other Asian countries took significant loans from the IMF during the crisis perhaps creating some moral hazard.

In Financial Crisis Theories Explaining the 1997 Thai Financial Crisis, Yoon explains that the first-generation model of unsustainable policies (fiscal deficits) and the second-generation model of self-fulfilling expectations and multiple equilibria insufficiently explain the Asan Financial Crisis (5). A third model of moral hazard, and a weakly regulated financial system drive weakness in the financial sector that may better explain the spread of the Thai crisis. For example, capital market liberalization contributed to “excessive borrowing from abroad. Moral hazard as a result of implicit or explicit government guarantees encouraged over-borrowing and excessive exposure to foreign exchange by financial institutions. When visible losses led governments to withdraw their implicit guarantees, foreign creditors suddenly withdrew their loans from even solvent borrowers and financial crisis erupt”. Other models also include the “sudden stop” of capital inflows.

Yoon accounts for the spread from Thailand to other countries via contagion channels like common shocks (high foreign debt burdens), trade linkages (neighboring countries’ loss of competitiveness), financial interdependence (common creditors), and information asymmetries (herding behavior where imperfectly informed investors get triggered by signals from informed individuals).

### Some Present Day Dynamics

My understanding here is introductory, and there is a lot to learn. The impact of COVID-19 from a macroeconomic perspective was immense. In an act to save the markets and prevent a complete economic meltdown, the government likely shifted a great deal of the debt burdens from the private sector to the public sector (e.g., MP3). 
Governments ran massive deficits (10-15% of GDP) and central banks printed money causing a monetary inflation. Fed bond holdings as a percentage of GDP jumped to lower interest rates. Commercial banks also bought a lot of treasuries that are now significantly devalued. Jiang et al., find a decline of $2.2 trillion in aggregate bank capital from the monetary tightening (1). The Deutsche Bundesbank along with other central banks may be in a tough spot.

In normal economic cycles, the private sector is more responsive to the tightening through typical credit channels. The economy is much harder to slow now due to higher levels of wage inflation. There are probably other reasons like the supply side/deglobalization. Resolving the labor imbalance to bring down inflation may likely be a painful process. Of course, governments should have tightened earlier but hindsight is 20/20. 

High inflation, high debt to GDP ratios, the large deficits, and strained central banks’ balance sheets are particularly dangerous factors for the future path of interest rates and eventually maybe the dollar. The current economic blueprint is not unlike that of a late-stage empire (Dalio, Musk). An important question is how the government will pay its bills. If deficits remain large there needs to be enough buyers of U.S. debt assuming the central bank does not print to make up the difference. 

A cycle may emerge where higher debt servicing costs leads to more debt needing to get issued. As a backstop, the central bank can simply buy the debt. However, inflation appears to be the limiting factor wherein the real return is no longer a viable investment for holders of the debt. Such a dynamic would be self-reinforcing where holders would sell debt, worsening the supply demand imbalance and raising inflation expectations. 

In effect, the government may take an inflationary path (print money) as extended deflation would probably not be politically or socially viable. To track the scenario, it is likely helpful to pay attention to foreign holders of U.S. debt. For example, Japan holds a significant portion. Higher inflation in Japan leading the BOJ to pursue tighter economic policy might be a dynamic worth paying attention to (3). Moreover, I am trying to better assess the extent to which MP3 is inflationary. It may depend on how inflation dynamics get entrenched in the labor market.

The above concerns are speculative, and will take time to play out. There is likely a potential *range* of outcomes with different probabilities. For example, military mobilization affects the dynamics. Additionally, technological innovations from venture capital to drive productivity growth would be helpful. 
One of our country’s top priorities should be education to remain competitive on the world stage.
Excessively decadent monetary policies from the last decade likely could have been better channeled into areas like infrastructure, education/research, and improving our democracy.
