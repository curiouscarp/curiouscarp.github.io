### Auto loan statistics

Auto loans are the second largest category of household debt at roughly 9.2% of the total. 
As of Q4 2023, auto debt comprised $1.6 trillion (1). 
According to lendingtree, payments at least 90 days late Q1 2024 are as high as 4.4% of the outstanding amount. 
The figure is up 13.4% year over year. (2). 
Americans in their 30s and 40s and those with the highest credit scores tend to borrow the most for auto loans. 
The average new lease is 36.1 months. 
The percentage of loans past 30 days due has risen sharply in recent quarters due to the higher interest rates.

### Lending

When someone wants to borrow money to finance the purchase of a vehicle, they typically fill out a credit application. 
A bank, credit union, or specialized auto financing company will verify the applicant’s credit history and employment status, along with other factors to determine eligibility.  
A downpayment can be made up front to reduce the amount that needs to get financed. 
A loan agreement specifies the terms of the contract including the amount to be finance, the interest rate structure, and the loan term. 
Repayments typically follow an amortized schedule in which monthly payments are made towards both interest and paying down the principal. 
It is possible we will see a sharp increase in the demand for cars in the next couple years.

### Global Markets

The Fed recently indicated a possible rate cut in September. 
Unemployment ticked up to 4.3 percent in the most recent jobs report. 
Payrolls grew by 114,000 much less than the estimate. 
Following the labor market weakness, the VIX hit 29.44 on Friday, yields fell significantly, and the NASDAQ is in correction territory. 
The DXY has fallen from the 106 high in June of 2024 to now 103. 
The Yen has strengthened significantly against the dollar from 161 during July to now 144. 
Ueda recently indicated additional hawkishness with the decision to raise short term rates to 0.25% on Wednesday. 
The BOJ penciled in at least two more 25bps hikes. 
Today, the VIX hit 55, the SP500 sold off 3%, and the Nikkei plunged 12%.  

The recent rise in unemployment triggered the Sahm rule. 
Named after Claudia Sahm, the rule provides a real-time metric for the state of the business cycle. 
According to the St. Louis Fed, the “Sahm Recession Indicator signals the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate (U3) rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its previous 12 month low.” 
The indicator has been accurate for previous recessions, so when the threshold is triggered, one may expect the unemployment rate to rise substantially in coming months. 
For example, the Sahm rule hit 0.53 in February 2008. 
The rule is designed as a stabilizer via fiscal policy.
