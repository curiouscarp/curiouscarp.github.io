U.S. markets have been rallying significantly in the past few weeks.
Overpriced markets are becoming more overpriced. 
Don't worry, you aren't missing anything.
Looking at history, we had market peaks in both October 2007 and February 2020.

The Nikkei has also been on a tear. 
At its most recent meeting, the BOJ kept policy rates negative.
The Japanese 10-year has 1% for its reference point. 
We will get a better idea if the BOJ begins to tighten in April given the state of the Japanese labor market. 
Recall, the Yen carry trade which involves borrowing at low yields to invest in higher yield areas. 
If we get a slowdown that will affect the profitability of the trade.
U.S. yields would drop, and the Yen would appreciate (figure 2). 
The Yen carry unwind in 2008 was significant part of the deleveraging process.

I think the dollar is in trouble in the coming years as previously mentioned. 
I am not arguing the U.S. will lose reserve currency status overnight; however, I think it would be remarkably foolish to assume fiat will remain stable given our national debt including unfunded liabilities. 
Traditional inflation hedges should outperform over the long term like commodities and precious metals.
The Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc tend to be safe-haven currencies. 

As per China, it has been a bloodbath for the past year (figure 3). 
Chinese authorities are looking to inject $278 billion from offshore accounts to stabilize the markets.
The U.S. media reports China's economy as weak, yet the authorities have tremendous restraint compared to the U.S.
If anything, the Chinese strategy is more beneficial in the long run, since they have significantly more room for monetary stimulation for future downturns. 
China has used aggressive stimulus for more severe property related downturns in the past, but with the benefit of hindsight the U.S. track record speaks for itself (e.g. Covid). 
We are running multi trillion-dollar World War 2 style deficits while unemployment is at cyclical lows. 
Of course people celebrate strong GDP prints.

Given my expectation of a strong deflationary impulse, I am preparing for a worldwide market selloff.
The timing is tough, but my best guess would be by the end of Q2, and I would be stunned if we are not in recession by the end of 2024. 
That would mean continued weakness in China along with a break in the Japanese and U.S. markets.
I am also expecting a large part of the banking system to fail, so we'll see some consolidation.
I wouldn't bet on pandemic style government checks this time around.
The mainstream media is incorrect or purposely misleading and the economists get it wrong by saying how "this time is different".
We live in an era of phoniness across multiple dimensions.
