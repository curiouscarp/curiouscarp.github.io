It would be interesting to compare our current macroeconomic environment with a particular focus on the labor markets to that of the 1970s to understand the role of monetary policy in regulating economic activity. 
Inflationary concerns from the past year have led to significant questions over the potential course of action of the Federal Reserve. 
The fear of overtightening resulting in poor real growth has sounded off some recessionary alarms worldwide. 
On the other hand, too little tightening can lead to entrenched inflation. 
In the 1970s, forex speculation and the end of Bretton Woods, high government spending, rising oil prices, and Arthur Burns at the Federal Reserve's helm led to stagflation before Volcker's intervention. 
Moreover, TFP growth in the 1970s through the early 1980s marked a significant slowdown in economic productivity, signifying a stark departure from the WW2 productivity booms. 

Today, goods inflation is beginning to cool, and services inflation is still relatively high. 
While potentially good news, theory asserts that significant drops in price level growth invariably lead to higher levels of unemployment. 
In fact, "since 1955, there has never been a quarter with price inflation above 4 percent and unemployment below 5 percent that was not followed by a recession within the next two years" (Domash & Summers, 2022).

The Atlanta Fed publishes wage inflation data, and the 6.1% figure for December 2022 is exceptionally high compared to the 1-3% we've seen in the past few decades. 
Barring a productivity boom, higher wages lead to increased price levels through increased consumption and higher operating costs on balance sheets. 
To reduce wage growth, one would naturally look at two variables: nominal spending and employment rates. Their current relationship puts upward pressure on wages since increased nominal spending since COVID has outpaced job growth on a relative basis. 
In short, without significant declines in the labor market the Fed may be resistant to lowering interest rates.

Moreover, I am under the impression that there exists significant lag in the transmission mechanism from changes in interest rates to changes in employment levels/nominal spending to changes in employee wages. 
The question becomes whether the increased interest rates over the past year will be able to bring about a significant change in these variables in the coming year without inflation becoming entrenched through wage-price spirals or leading to a severe downturn. 
Some evidence from the likes of Domash & Summers would lead one to believe that a "soft landing" like 1965, 1984, and 1994 would be challenging given the tight labor market, relatively low real interest rates, and relatively high wage growth levels. 
In other words, labor market conditions are extreme enough by historical standards that there exists little margin for a healthy adjustment without precipitating a labor market shock. On the other hand, research from the Fed of San Francisco fits the Beveridge curve using recent unemployment-vacancy data. They find we are on a steeper part of the curve suggesting unemployment may not rise substantially as a result of rising vacancies. 
However, the authors note their analysis does not include job separations due to factors like layoffs typically seen in a recessionary environment.

Building off the 1970s, I am curious about the extent to which this round of tightening will be effective enough in stomping out inflation. 
Germany needed a single round, whereas the U.K. had three phases of rate hikes between 1972 and 1975. 
Lower levels of unionization compared to the 1970s could also be an interesting point of comparison to understand the effect of bargaining power on wage growth. Though the two periods are markedly different, Mark Twain once said, "history doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."
