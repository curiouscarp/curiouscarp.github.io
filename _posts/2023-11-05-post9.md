**"The ultimate purpose of economics, of course, is to understand and promote the enhancement of well-being." - Ben Bernanke**

In a previous post I stated that drops in price levels invariably lead to higher levels of unemployment. 
This got me thinking about the Phillips curve a bit and the relationship is not always clear. 
There was a much stronger relationship between the two variables in the 1950s and the 1960s. 

The Keynesian perspective places a heavy emphasis on the short-run trade-offs where policy can be used as a lever to toggle along the Phillips curve. 
However, the stagflationary environment of the 1970s could not be well explained by Keynesians. 
Monetarists like Friedman argue that there exists a short run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, but it is temporary. 
By incorporating expectations, monetary policy can increase (decrease) the money supply and increase (decrease) inflation without decreasing (increasing) unemployment over the long run. 
For example, factors like technology might play a larger role in affecting long term employment outcomes. 
The theory points towards a long-run neutrality of money where changes in the money supply do not have a sustained impact on real economic variables.

With credit spreads starting to widen on the margin and a weakening labor market, the U.S. is slipping into a recessionary environment. 
European growth is already weakening significantly. 
Despite the less clear-cut relationship in the Phillips curve, the interaction between interest rates and debt maturities is likely an important factor.
For example, most of the mortgages in the U.S. are fixed rate. A lot of banks are sitting on devalued securities. Unlike the 2008 crisis where ARMs, ninja loans, and teaser rates created a subprime bubble the situation today is worse by orders of magnitude. The public sector indebtedness and higher inflation will likely reduce the effectiveness of stimulative monetary policy. In other words, the playbook that got us out of 2008 may not work. 
While nonfinancial corporate debt is likely an issue as I have been learning about, the pandemic stimulus allowed for massive refinancing.
The Wikipedia article previously attached understates these dynamics. 
That said, IG & HY spreads look pretty tight. 
I also think Wells Fargo is doing a good job of warning about the coming crisis.

I have come to accept that business cycle fluctations are a natural extention of the world we live in. It is also imperative to ponder the very real economic and social consequences. 
If we are entering a severe contraction (or perhaps an economic depression), then one might also naturally be concerned about a lost generation of workers. 
For example, those who recently started a job or are looking for one may be in a precarious situation as unemployment increases and capital markets freeze. 
While "unemployment" might be an economic term, one should consider the devestating reality of potentially millions of people getting laid off.
The purchasing power of fixed savings may significantly weaken if the dollar collapses over the next couple years.
Furthermore, our contemporary society exhibits some resemblances to the Gilded Age, marked by pronounced wealth disparities and diminished social mobility (substitute economic growth from the Second Industrial Revolution with artificial asset price inflation). 
The coming global crisis will not only end in tears but will serve to intensify the sense of disillusionment pervading our society.

In such times it is also important to recall the lessons from history like the 1930s. 
I think world leaders have a moral obligation to acknowledge the existence of a viable path forward through diplomacy.
Finding scapegoats by blaming economic problems on racial or religious groups is likely not a wise course of action. 
Why don't we instead envision a scenario where the major powers abandon military escalations, resolve disputes by identifying common ground, and strengthen economic ties through mutually beneficial arrangements? 
Instead of sleepwalking our way into World War 3, we should consider the rewards of cooperation that would strengthen the globe for the decades to come.

I also want to endorse X (formerly Twitter). 
It prioritizes freedom of speech, identifies false content, and is eliminating bots. 
Musk is also working to transform the platform into an everything app backed by core democratic values.
Why read a newspaper (with literally yesterday's news) when one can obtain real time updates on important developments from the foremost experts in their respective fields? 
Throughout the past couple years, I have come to enjoy learning from highly regarded investment professionals and economists.
