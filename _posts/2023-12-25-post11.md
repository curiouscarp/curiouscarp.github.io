### State of the Market

The treasury market has been rallying recently. 
The 10-year yield on October 23, 2023 was 4.86% and now it is closer to 3.9%. 
Technically, T-Bills have maturity dates from a few days to a year, T-Notes have maturity dates 2 to 10 years, and T-Bonds have maturity dates 10 to 30 years. 
The yield curve as measured by the 10Y3M spread is now more inverted, reaching levels not seen since around June.
German bund yields have also been selling off. 
I did not expect the recent bond rally though it makes sense given the news about a dovish Fed pivot.
The move in longer term bond yields can be a result of portfolio rebalancing or a flight to safety (higher demand for liquidity). 
Ironically, the rally undid some of the tightening, prompting a risk on attitude in the markets (figure 1, figure 2). 
This is a very classic move at the end of hiking cycles. 
The Fed’s actions came after cracks emerged in the labor market in a sign that the economy could be getting back to the healthy 2% target. 
Disinflation has also come from supply side factors like the fixing of pandemic related disruptions in supply chains. 
At the median, policymakers see three cuts in 2024 and another full point cut in 2025.

### Some 2023 Lessons and Future Outlook

To be frank, I was expecting a much weaker economy by now based upon my own macroeconomic research. 
I think one of the important takeaways is that money does not get “expensive” until the real rate of interest (RRI) as expressed by the Fisher Equation turns positive w.r.t r*. 
The delta in the RRI is a key force. Even with student loan payments resuming and a weakening consumer credit impulse, wages are a primary driver behind the current nominal economic activity. 
In this way, a wage-phillips model helps one understand the economic resilience; however, it may not be as useful to understand the interplay between public sector debt, private sector debt, and the derivatives market, for example. As a side note, a whopping 22 million borrowers had a payment due in October for student loans, and about 8.8 million failed to make their payment by the middle of November. 
I expect subprime borrowers (especially those on floating rate packages) to face significant headwinds in the future. 

As an investor I think one of the most attractive plays right now in the market would be T-bills. 
The 3 month is yielding a very solid 5.22%. Moreover, my base case is a significant economic slowdown within the next couple quarters.
Rapid fed cuts to stimulate the economy would cause a capital gain as the yields on the older securities would become more attractive compared to newly issued securities in the lower rate environment (figure 3). 
Also, consider the incentive to own equities against bills.

I do think the lag effects are still in play. 
This has been one of the most aggressive tightening cycles and should not be underestimated. 
The last mile of inflation tends to be the most difficult part to bring down and “less progress has been made in moderating inflation in wage-sensitive core services” (PIMCO). 
Given my base case of an economic slowdown, I think an interesting opportunity for institutional level investors could be protection on high yield debt via credit default swaps. 
Some benefits compared to the T-bill play are less cash outlay and more upside potential. 
One might also say that the NASDAQ is just a tad overpriced. Just a tad.
