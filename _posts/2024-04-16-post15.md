I've compiled some recent macro trends regarding the U.S. and abroad.

### United States

The economy has been growing at a very healthy rate despite the rate hikes. 
Looking at high yield spreads, financial conditions are less restrictive than they were at the beginning of the rate hiking cycle. 
The stock market has also been staying afloat. Public and private sector job growth has been strong. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased over 300,000 in March and unemployment is under 4%. 
Wage inflation is still over 4%. 
“Higher for longer” policy is the name of the game as indicated by futures markets, and the previous episode of disinflation was likely transitory.

Given that we are in a wage driven economic cycle, the main way to slow the economy is via higher long-term yields. 
In my view, the Fed should hike at least once more unless things begin to break. 
A rate hike, however, would mean that the Federal Reserve’s initial outlook was incorrect. 
One of the interesting things about macro seems to be how often both policymakers and practioners use dubious models that do not correspond with real world outcomes. 
Yields have risen across the board in recent weeks with the 10-year at 4.65% and the 30-year at 4.75%.

While hiking rates increases the risk of exacerbating the problems in CRE, people deserve lower inflation. 
Y/Y CPI has been above 2% since March 2021 evidencing a continued erosion of purchasing power. 
Office values have already been plunging. New York Bancorp (NYCB), Aozora Bank, and Deutsche Bank all faced turmoil. 
For example, NYCB recently posted a massive loss of over $250 million. 
The effects are expected to reverberate across the industry. 
Since paper values have fallen, new transactions will lead to marking to market.

### Japan and the Middle East

In March of 2024 the BoJ shifted monetary policy from negative interest rates to 0-.1 percent, signifying a major shift in its QE stance. 
Instead of trying to generate inflation, the BOJ’s hawkish move represents an effort to dial back. 
Previous of inflationary pressures were likely driven by Federal Reserve action rather than Japanese QE (e.g. purchasing ETFs, REITs, corporate bonds, commercial papers, etc). 
Aside from being the largest creditor nation, Japan has massive public debt burdens at over 250% of GDP (mostly being held by the BOJ). 
Interest payments on Japanese debt is expected to rise. 

A shrinking and aging population slow GDP growth and increase welfare costs. 
An article from the St. Louis Fed explains Japan’s risky asset position with many domestic equities and foreign bonds/equities that provide high returns. 
In this way, the government can maintain high debt levels despite its deficits. 
It is probably worth looking into how a global economic slowdown would affect Japanese government finances.

In recent weeks, the Yen has weakened to about 155 per dollar toward a multi-decade low. 
The move has been driven by a stronger U.S. dollar. The DXY index measures the dollar against six other currencies. 
Higher for longer interest rates in the U.S. make yield differentials more attractive in turn amplifying dollar denominated assets. 
Valuable U.S. dollars are most dangerous for emerging market economies that have high foreign debt burdens.

Tensions in the Middle East also may have contributed to recent market volatility and the move in the dollar. 
As the conflict develops the markets react accordingly. 
For example, WTI crude oil futures contracts increased in value. 
On a side note, cocoa futures have continued to appreciate from deficient harvests due to extreme weather conditions in Ghana, and the Ivory Coast, among other countries. 
Some metals have also rallied which may be attributed to the rise in inflationary pressures. 
Corn prices, on the other hand, have declined.

I also love X. It is the best place to get news.
