  I have developed an interest in looking at the world through a probabilistic lens. Varying degrees of randomness dictate the course of our lives. Despite evolution, we still seem astoundingly bad at understanding the outsized influence of chance. For example, consider simplistic rationalizations about hindsight events or the failure to account for survivorship bias when assessing the prospect of opening a restaurant. We assess possibilities of the unknown to guide decision-making in real-time.

  The well-documented narrative fallacy captures a problem with human understanding and highly optimized heuristics. We are drawn to simple explanations for remarkably complex phenomena. Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahneman lays out the framework for such thinking patterns in the classic *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Most of the time, our desire to obtain some rudimentary sense of understanding is ineffective at best and risky at worst. Reductionist approaches tend to ignore the role chance plays in success, the tens of thousands of others who have failed in a similar pursuit and chalk it up to some retrospective determinism.

  To the dismay of a young athlete, extreme outliers dictate much of the phenomena in our world. For example, tournament theory lays a basis for the "winner takes all" phenomena regarding labor contracts. Additionally, no amount of practice can replace the randomness of luck. Those on the far right of a highly positively skewed distribution make it to the professional leagues. 

  I am fascinated with the work done by Nassim Taleb, a Lebanese-American statistician. He explains a similar phenomenon (initially identified by sociologist Robert Merton) concerning the luck involved in obtaining academic citations. Luck transcends academia. Trends dictated by power law dynamics also underpin the venture capital industry, wealth distribution, social contagion, computer networks, and the art world. You get the point. 

  A majority of the time, events express a degree of regularity. Thus, we arrive at some status quo. Consider the outsized role of some adverse black swan events: COVID-19, the 2008 Financial Crisis, and 9/11. These occurrences influence policy, strategy, and attitudes in staggering ways. The interconnectedness of society from globalization further increases the magnitude of the black swan event consequences. Think about global systemic risk now against two hundred years ago.

  On a more positive note, innovation and jumps in progress are a natural extension of black swans due to their lack of predictability. The beauty of capitalism are the rewards to lucky individuals who instigate broad changes through precise, repeated tinkering. The original design of computers to execute a series of tractable instructions has morphed society in wildly unimaginable ways. Penicillin's discovery was entirely accidental. These "extreme" events tend to guide technological progress. 

  According to Black Swan theory, such events on the far end of a distribution exhibiting high kurtosis (fat tails) have outsized influence relative to the frequency of their occurrence. We tend to underestimate their disproportionate role in our lives. Thus, it is helpful to reframe our understanding of probabilities concerning such high sigma events. 

  A problem we see with Gaussian models is the underestimation of these tails. Just take a look at monthly SP500 returns. Alternatively, consider the actual vs. theoretical frequency of severe market drawdowns and apply Bayes Theorem. The observations of white swans do not confirm the inexistence of black ones. With this framework, black swan theory builds off polymath Benoit Mandelbrot's work on fractal randomness. Statistically self-similar and exponentially scalable distributions are a natural extension of the world we inhabit. We can observe stratifications from power law distributions and the various affinities between those spreads not evident in gaussian strata. There are many justifications for power law dynamics. 

  So, why has the bell curve become so prevalent? Are its potentially incorrect applications inconsequential? Taleb recognizes the difficulty in obtaining different distributions in the wild due to statistical circularity (sampling to get distributions but deriving sampling rules based on distribution assumptions). On the other hand, it is straightforward to derive some clean properties after assuming normality, a primary reason for its ubiquitous acceptance. When we presume Gaussian, sampling is clear, and the law of large numbers and central limit theorem play nicely.

*Which comes from a fat tailed distribution?*

  Most obviously, one of the dangers of the overuse of Gaussian models is increased risk and exposure to the black swans (see LTCM). Modern portfolio theory, Black Scholes models, and linear regression techniques build upon such assumptions. While predicting black swan events is impossible by definition, it is advantageous to be aware of their existence. All sorts of traps that hinder our understanding of the role of chance while reinforcing assumptions of normality litter our minds. 

  It is easy to vastly underestimate the outsized role of luck and the impact of the improbable in shaping our lives. Our existence on earth at this moment in time is a culmination of black swans. One good strategy might be to gain exposure to positive black swans to hedge against negative ones. Some general lessons from these theorizations would be to seek out potential asymmetric opportunities, avoid herds, and look for nonobvious counter-evidence instead of seemingly prominent points that confirm our naive narratives.
