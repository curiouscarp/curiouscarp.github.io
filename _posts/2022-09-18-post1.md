I have developed an interest in looking at the world through a probabilistic lens. Varying degrees of randomness dictate the course of our lives. Despite evolution, we still seem astoundingly bad at understanding the outsized influence of chance. For example, consider simplistic rationalizations about hindsight events or the failure to account for survivorship bias when assessing the prospect of opening a restaurant. We assess possibilities of the unknown to guide decision-making in real-time.

This is **my very first post**!! I can write

* unnumbered
* fancy
* lists

But also

1. numbered
1. ones
1. easily
