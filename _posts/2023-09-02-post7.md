Hello, 

Last summer I initiated a process of introspection regarding my values and the insights garnered from past experiences. I launched the blog with the intention of aiding my job search after completing my studies at Vanderbilt University. The foundation of my ideas rests upon academic research I conducted during an independent study in my junior year. I am of the belief that there are significant global challenges that warrant more extensive discussion.

The looming possibility of an economic collapse and the prevalence of censorship have left these subjects inadequately addressed within mainstream media channels. Despite residing in the Information Age, the task of discerning truth has become increasingly difficult. I propose that we ought to elevate the importance of freedom of speech, logical reasoning, and rationality, all in the pursuit of benefiting humanity, upholding national stability, and fostering global peace. 

Let us first consider the array of problems. Policies have been marred by various abuses: reckless expenditures, insufficient regulatory supervision, excessive financial leverage, lax lending standards, and unregulated (***naked***) short selling. For instance, in the United States, we’re confronting alarming levels of debt across areas like student loans, auto financing, and credit card balances. The alarming surge in crypto assets, corporate debt, real estate valuations, SPACs, equities, synthetic derivatives, and asset-backed securities has placed the entire global economy in jeopardy, all for the sake of profits. These issues, like a cancer, possess the potential to impact every corner of the world, particularly as elevated interest rates could result in unsustainable debt servicing. 

Present indicators offer insights into the situation. The Senior Loan Officer Survey (SLOOS) provides valuable data on bank lending practices. This survey encompasses around eighty major domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and foreign bank agencies. The survey seeks to capture changes in standards, terms, and demand for bank loans extended to businesses and household over the preceding quarter. In Figure 1, I superimposed a SLOOS historical trend indicating domestic banks tightening lending for commercial and industrial loans to large and middle-market firms upon the percentage change in real Gross Domestic Income (GDI) and the percentage change in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Notably, GDI has already taken a negative turn, and bank lending practices have shown signs of tightening over the past few quarters. Federal Reserve economist Jeremy Nalewaik suggests that GDI could prove to be a valuable indicator, given that “advance estimates of GDI are closer to the final estimates of both measures” (1). In Figure 2, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicator (LEI) also signals weaker economic activity ahead (2).

In terms of consumption (which constitutes 70% of GDP), individuals are presently depleting their excess savings accrued during the pandemic, while impending student loan repayments are slated to recommence in October (3,4). Intuition suggests that this could potentially impact how households allocate their budgets (16). Figure 3 illustrates the recent upswing in delinquency rates across various classes such as consumer loans, credit cards, and auto loans (5).

A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) falls within the realm of asset backed securities (ABS) and generates cash flow in the form of a bond (6). This bond offers a fixed income rate through a securitization process, often facilitated by a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Diverse types of CDOs exist including Collateralized Bond Obligations (CBOs), and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs, reminiscent of the 2008 crisis). A concerning trend persists on Wall Street: debt instruments continue to be securitized based on a hazardous presumption of perpetual asset price appreciation and continuous consumer strength. 

CDOs are typically backed by various types of consumer loans, such as home mortgages, student loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables. Figure 4 illustrates a conventional CDO structure (7). The different tranches within this structure offer payouts consisting of a base interest rate along with additional compensation for the associated risk profile. While my knowledge of these complex financial instruments is limited, my belief is that CDOs can encounter substantial losses across their tranche arrangement in the face of an economic downturn. Products that are labeled as "safe" are often awarded elevated ratings to maximize profitability. The predicament with these investment instruments lies in their design to generate payouts exceeding the combined worth of their components, achieved through Gaussian copula models that underestimate tail risk.

I also find the situation regarding student loans to be concerning. Currently, there is a total outstanding debt of approximately $1.6 trillion owed by 43 million borrowers, equating to an average of roughly $37,000 per borrower. The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), which provided subsidies and guarantees for loans, came to an end in 2010. The existence of this program, backed by government guarantees before 2010, potentially incentivized risky lending practices. Although the discontinuation of the original program led to a decline in student loan securitization initially, the private sector stepped in to meet the excess demand for loans from students who had reached their public loan limits (8,9,10).

Companies like Sallie Mae, SoFi, and Ascent offer loans that get securitized in the form of student loan asset backed securities (SLABs). Although the process of securitization facilities increased borrowing accessibility, I raise concerns about the lending standards that have been employed. The minimum FICO scores necessary typically fall within the mid-600s range, don’t have income requirements, and are unsecured. Private loans can be more dangerous than federal loans since they have higher interest rates and generally lack borrower assistance. 

Investopedia gives an example of an S&P Global Ratings analysis of the “SoFi Professional Loan Program 2021-B Trust.” The document finds a default rate assumption of 2.35%, up from the initial 2.25% due to the impact of COVID-19 (11). The rating assigned is ‘AAA’. Given a standard 10-year repayment plan, it would be interesting to use this as a template to consider older vintages. I am curious as to accuracy of projected stressed cash flow modeling assumptions like cumulative default rates in scenarios with high proportions of subprime borrowers or variable rate loans. Additionally, typical loan qualification methods like debt-to-income ratios are likely to come under significant pressure as nominal wages fall. This raises questions about the extent to which ratings agencies grant favorable ratings to various ABSs in the pursuit of profitability. I believe there should be increased regulatory oversight and transparency concerning these systems. Naturally, if an average individual misconstrued their capability to repay a loan, it would be deemed unlawful. 

On the positive side, the White House introduced the SAVE Plan a couple weeks ago, aimed at reducing monthly payments for millions of borrowers. The plan utilizes an “income-driven repayment (IDR) plan,” which calculates payments based on a borrower's income and family size rather than their loan balance. Furthermore, it offers forgiveness for balances after a specific number of years (17). The plan's primary objectives are to halve undergraduate loan payments, potentially reduce some borrowers' payments to as low as $0, prevent balance growth for borrowers who meet their required payments, and grant early forgiveness for borrowers with low balances (17). While this plan may offer some relief, I have reservations about how transferring some of the financial burden to taxpayers may impact the long-term cost of college. To put things into perspective, Figure 5 displays the composition of household debt. Student loan debt constitutes only 9% of total household debt, compared to 70% for mortgages.

I also aim to briefly delve into the topic of the overleveraged corporate sector (14). Allow me to paint a picture: within the United States, corporate debt stands at 81.1% of GDP. Beyond these borders, several nations exhibit corporate debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 100%. Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are comprised of corporate loans with low credit ratings (falling below investment grade) or loans secured by private equity firms for leveraged buyouts (LBOs). These CLOs generally encompass a range of 150 to 250 individual loans. Should a significant loss be incurred by a CLO, it's plausible that the impact could extend further up the tranche structure than initially anticipated, particularly if default correlations are underestimated, like the scenarios with CDOs and SLABs. I have limited knowledge, but entities holding exposure to such products could potentially encounter substantial losses because of Wall Street's short-term perspective.

The substantial Quantitative Easing (QE) measures undertaken in the previous decade likely contributed to the “mispricing of risk as investors sought out higher yielding debt like junk bonds. For example, high-yield debt has historically yielded 10% or more to compensate investors for increased risk. In February 2020, the U.S. yield on these bonds dipped to nearly 5%” (12). Illustrated in Figure 6 is the exponential growth of U.S. corporate bonds held by mutual funds (12). Over the span from 2010 to 2019, the corporate bond sector expanded by a staggering $5.1 trillion (13). A substantial portion of this growth can be attributed to insurance companies and overseas investors, as depicted in Figure 7 (13). Evidently, there is a noticeable increase in bond downgrades underway (Figure 8). Given these trends, it would be reasonable to anticipate a surge in bankruptcy cases.

Banerjee and Hofmann posit that the presence of zombie firms points to a fundamental misallocation of resources (14). They define zombies as “firms that are unable to cover debt servicing costs from current profits over an extended period” (14). Metrics such as net debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest coverage ratios likely hold significance in this context. Notably, a substantial number of corporate bonds are structured as covenant-lite (cov-lite), which is an intriguing trend. By mid-2018, “77.4% of U.S. leveraged corporate loans were cov-lite. Cov-lite loans as a percentage of outstanding leveraged loans in the European markets reached 78% in 2018, compared to under 10% in 2013” (12). These diminished safeguards appear to amplify the likelihood of sluggish economic recovery rates in the event of a downturn (12). The counterintuitive nature of higher leverage not leading to more robust loan provisions is evident—a phenomenon driven by short-term perspectives once again.

Although I firmly believe capitalism constitutes the most effective system, it would be imprudent to regard it as flawless. The intricate framework we've erected, leveraging cheap debt (commonly referred to as "easy money") driven by overwhelming greed, raises a profound concern for our democracy and the very fabric of our civilization. In light of structurally elevated inflation levels in comparison to the 2010s, the position of central banks is bound to be complex. Instead of fostering a foundation that originates from the grassroots, we've dedicated the past 13 years to constructing the largest asset bubble in history, a phenomenon that disproportionately favored the already privileged individuals entrenched in power.

When did we lose sight of the principles passed down to us by our founding fathers? Why do these self-evident truths seem exceptionally elusive within mainstream media platforms? I'm uncertain. As the consequences of our actions manifest, it's crucial to acknowledge that the ongoing crisis doesn't solely stem from current policies. Instead, it is a culmination of a series of mistakes and reckless pursuits fueled by greed. This sequence of events led to the creation of an internet bubble around the turn of the century, followed by a housing bubble shortly after, and now an encompassing "everything bubble." Recognizing these historical facts serves as a prerequisite for forging a healthier path forward.

These times present humanity with its most significant trial. I urge you to reflect on what it means to be a global citizen in the current climate. How can we collectively bolster stability amidst the upheaval? Naturally, the solutions are far from simple. Through my unwavering quest for truth in recent years, I've realized we are all human at our core. The foundation of the United States rests on the tenets of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." What kind of world do we wish to shape for the generations to come? How can we enhance our democratic systems? The essence lies in prioritizing enduring solutions over momentary gratifications to safeguard the civilization we've painstakingly constructed over the previous millennia. We've inherited this world from our forebears, and it's our duty to preserve it rather than dismantle it.

If we are to secure the survival of our species, we must elevate one another. What does this entail? It necessitates engaging in challenging conversations about what is factual rather than resorting to violence and censorship. We must strive to discover common ground on divisive matters, united by our shared humanity, by attentively considering viewpoints that differ from our own. Confronting historical injustices, we must proceed with courage, nonviolence, and reason. The media has been employed as a divisive tool, sowing discord among us. While agreement on every issue might not be attainable, the stability of our nation must take precedence, for without it, everything else loses significance. By addressing our political, economic, and geopolitical disparities through a more rational approach, we can aspire to shape a more harmonious world. It is my hope that we can peacefully resolve the intricate challenges confronting our planet, for we have no alternative but to do so.
