### Meme Stocks?

We got some nice movements in some meme stocks recently including AMC and GME. 
As of today, AMC is up 80% on the month and GME is up 194% on the month. 
RoaringKitty is back and is posting some dank memes. 
Congratulations to all shareholders who made money with the recent gains. 
These short sellers are rigging the market against the entire world. 
It is unfair and the media acts clueless!

It is possible we have some more upside. 
I think we can get rich while taking Wall Street down. 
Options expire tomorrow. 
Depending on where the stocks end up, I believe the open interest on the options chain could lead to a gamma ramp. 
Remember that market makers deliver underlying shares when calls expire ITM which can drive the price up.

Additionally, positive sentiment on social media (Twitter, Reddit, etc) leads to increased buying pressure. 
I haven’t analyzed the money flows leading to the most recent moves. 
There could be some institutional pressure.

### Looking Ahead

People deserve an honest stock market. 
Plain and simple. 
My understanding is that the system is designed to keep people broke, unhappy, and continuously working. 
We go through life eating the wrong foods advertised by mainstream media for the benefit of big pharma. 
Healthy food is expensive and unhealthy food is cheap. 
You’re told to go to school to land a job without realizing all the debt you can incur. 
Then, you work 40 hours a week for decades at a shot to secure a retirement. 
The dollars in your 401k are in rigged market and then taxed to help fund our fiscally irresponsible government. 


While the system is clearly messed up, I think meme stocks are here to change that. 
On the other hand, the cost of short squeezes is high for future generations.
If we do get the ultimate short squeeze, I think that could mark the end of the modern world as we know it. 
You will get significant inflation and our currency will become virtually worthless in a short span of time. 
I think it is plausible that COVID-19 set up the framework for an enslaved world and was designed to extinguish individual thinking. 
All shareholders have the responsibility to make the planet into a better place and restore the balance of power.

While looking for things to write about, I read that some celebrities harvest the blood of tortured children in trafficking rings to create elixirs of youth.
I haven't looked into it much but that sounds insane. Welp, that got dark fast.
