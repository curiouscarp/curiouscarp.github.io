### Introduction to Private Equity (PE)

I plan to do a piece on the emerging complications with respect to auto, student, and credit card debt, but given my recent exploration into corporate debt, it makes more sense to discuss PE first. 
PE involves investing in private companies or moving publicly traded companies private. Firms raise money from limited partners (LPs) that may be pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, or sovereign wealth funds. 
The limited partners deploy some capital for an extended period and might pay some fees. The fund manager is the general partner (GP). 
A holding period might be 3-7 years. The illiquidity comes at the benefit of supposedly higher returns over the long run. 
After some due diligence, a private equity firm negotiates with the company’s owners to buy a stake or take it private. 
Exits might include selling the company to another firm or taking it public via IPO. Blackstone, KKR, and the Warburg Pincus are some of the largest firms among about 18,000. 

A common strategy involves leveraged buyouts (LBOs) where PE firms gain a controlling stake in a mature company by taking on debt attached to a small portion of equity. 
The borrowed money that is used to purchase the equity of the target company becomes the target company’s debt after the LBO. 
By using leverage, a firm maximizes its return on equity, since the net increase in the company’s value gets divvied up by partners. 
Assuming the company continues to gain value via cost cutting measures, revenue enhancement, or restructuring activities, higher rates of leverage provide higher returns. 
Metrics used to model returns might involve revenue growth, margin expansion, free cash flow generation, or valuation multiple expansions. 
Acquisition debt tends to be non-recourse. There are other types of strategies like distressed securities or growth capital. 
I have not learned too much about these styles yet. 

### A Brief Look at 21st Century PE

Just like other sectors of the economy, PE follows a boom bust pattern. 
Private equity firms did well until the tech bubble started popping in 2000. 
Firms overly exposed to internet and telecom companies like HM Capital underperformed. 
2003 marked the start of a 5 year golden age featuring some of the largest LBOs in history. 
Lower interest rates encouraged investors to seek out high yield debt, which fueled larger deals.
Blackstone's IPO in June of 2007 with a 12.3% stake for $4.13 billion was a symbol of the emerging private market powerhouse. 

The same story of history played out. 
By late 2007 the housing market turmoil affected leveraged finance markets as yield spreads widened. 
The government (tax payer) bail outs via new lending facilities, QE, and interest rate cuts sowed the seeds for the next PE boom. 
PE deal activity rose steadily from 2009 to 2019. 
For the past decade or so, the private markets have been consistently generating returns above the public markets. 
PE funds might yield 10-15% whereas annualized average SP500 returns are closer to around 6-8%. PE has also been playing a larger role in corporate ownership over time. 
One can observe an inflection point by 2012. 

Figure 1:

In particular, private equity vintages from 2019 to 2022 were supported by sky high valuation metrics, low interest rates, and strong expectations for future growth. 
Average purchase prices as reflected by EBITDA multiples increased by nearly 40% from 2010 to 2022. 
Bloomberg shows a 12x average LBO purchase price multiple at the height of the bubble. 
The same metric was 7.7x in 2009. 

Figure 2: (2)

A lot of the 2020 and 2021 deals were probably poorly constructed by failing to account for possible inflation. 
There was a boom in tech LBOs which became roughly one third of buyout deals in 2021. 
Lisa Lee explains that recurring revenue loans are an innovation that allow for lenders to finance growth-stage companies that have low or negative EBITDA (1). 
The number of firms making recurring revenue loans tripled since 2018. 
One could visualize what happens to cash burning companies in an economic slowdown. 
Moreover, the usage of “add-backs” became prevalent to make flattering adjustments to earnings. 
In a small corner of the PE space, there is also a somewhat ironic practice of NAV lending where equity managers take out loans against the underlying portfolio of companies (which are already highly levered and are sensitive to economic conditions) to meet liquidity needs.

In addition to credit risk, many buyout firms failed to hedge interest rate risk. 
For example, in the U.S., nearly 75% of the “floating-rate debt taken out during the leveraged-buyout boom lacked hedges as recently as August” (3). 
According to Oaktree about two thirds of the $1.4 trillion U.S. leveraged loans market was unprotected at the end of 2021. Blakstad from Validus Risk Management says that “many buyout firms, as well as the finance teams at the companies they acquired, considered hedging a waste of time and money” (3). 
I have attached in figure 3 the LSTA US Leveraged Loan weighted average yield. 
Interest rates work like gravity. Higher rates increase the cost of debt, lower debt capacities for deals, lower valuations, and strain cash flows. 

Figure 3: (5)

Deals have been decelerating (figure 4), cash flows for PE investors turned negative (figure 5), and business sales are down heavily (figure 6). 
A lot of the deals performed in the PE space based on overly optimistic projections may be in trouble. 
I am also learning about the reliability of the evaluation metrics. For example, Buffett and Munger (among others) raised concerns about EBITDA.
Others have lauded its dependableness especially when compared to net income.

Despite the already tricky environment for PE, I expect further chop in the seas ahead. 
One may want to batten down the hatches in case of a rogue wave. 
While leveraged loan defaults have risen only slightly in recent quarters, the reliance on covenant-lite deals may be destructive. 
Fund managers with a skew toward bubble vintages will likely underperform. 
However, given the lack of liquidity and historical precedent, one might expect less volatility in the private markets compared to the public ones.

### Meme Stocks

As an update on the meme stocks, BBBY is currently in the chapter 11 bankruptcy process. 
I have been going through some of the bankruptcy documentation and exploring online resources. 
Michael Goldberg with Akerman LLP has been hired as the chapter 11 plan administrator. 
His knowledge in dealing with unraveling high-profile investor fraud including Ponzi schemes is likely useful.

Buy Buy Baby is an American big-box retail chain that sells clothing for infants and young children. 
Its parent company is Bed Bath and Beyond. Dream On Me is a long-time supplier to Buy Buy Baby. 
Over the past summer, Dream on Me bought Buy Buy Baby’s intellectual property and got 11 store leases at auction. 
Dom Family LLC is a holding company that owns Dream on Me and may be associated with Carl/Brett Icahn. 
For example, there is speculation that DOM Inc, founded by Mark Serure, sold the company privately or is a mechanism through which Carl/Brett operate for M&A. 
Also, over the summer, Overstock bought out Bed Bath and Beyond’s intellectual property and digital assets for $21.5 million in a separate auction. 

Another important element are the net operating losses (NOLs) which refer to the losses that a business incurred over time. 
These can be utilized to offset taxable income generated in future years, so if a company becomes profitable after emerging from bankruptcy the NOLs are valuable to reduce or eliminate its tax liability on income. 
For example, NOLs can be used to offset capital gains from the sale of assets. 
There are intricate rules surrounding the limitations on how far back one can carry losses and how far into the future one can carry them forward. 
Bed Bath and Beyond has about $1.6 billion in NOLs that an acquiring entity could use assuming share ownership restrictions don’t come into play under section 382 of the Bankruptcy Code. 

Recall Carl Icahn owns IEP. On July 10, 2023 Icahn Enterprises released a 13D filing. 
In it he pledges a loan agreement secured against an "aggregate of 320 million Depositary Units owned by Mr. Icahn and $2 billion of interests owned by Mr. Icahn in the private investment funds managed by the Issuer."
With IEP at a market price of about $34 at the time of filing, the loan agreement amounts to about $13 billion. 
Twitter evidences a connection between Ryan Cohen and Icahn. 
The filing could represent an attempt to gain some kind of stake to help bring it out of bankruptcy.
I will say that I do have limited knowledge regarding the bankruptcy process. 

I have located two large claims attached below. 
One is from July 14th, 2023, and the other is from October 26th, 2023, both by Brandon Meadows from Addison Holdings LLC. 
In addition, summary 1 shows 652.5 hours on M&A activity.
If the claims are simply a right to a payment, then they would not necessarily be associated with Icahn. 

Claim 1:

Claim 2:

Summary 1:

![summary](/assets/images/MA.png)

An entity has been established called 20230930-DK-Butterfly-1 Inc. 
If the company is liquidating, they probably wouldn't be updating filings in multiple states. 
It looks like Sue Gove was named CEO in an October 1st filing. 
Aside from the NOLs, short sellers who have previously borrowed and (naked) sold shares could be on the hook for reissued shares in a successful restructuring. Citadel is not the only one swimming naked.
A likely occurrence would be margin calls associated with the shorts on the original BBBY shares, so the emerging entity could sell into a squeeze becoming debt free and building a cash base for future operations.
As an example, a reverse merger involves a privately held company seeking to go public. 
The private company enters into a merger agreement with a shell company, exchanges shares, and the publicly traded shell company becomes the new public face of the private company. 
The company’s shares then get publicly traded on an exchange. 

Some have hypothesized there may be a large entity eventually emerging on the called ‘Teddy’ as some kind of Amazon competitor. 
Building off the momentum from taking down corrupt financial institutions, the all-in-one ecommerce platform would offer many in house services. 
I believe Ryan Cohen and Carl/Brett are looking to bring their vision to life. 
I also admire Pulte’s support for the community along with countless others. 
In any case, it will be interesting to see what kind of deal emerges (if there is one).

Crypto: I am not sure why a dead coin would be rallying. Perhaps, it relates to counterparty risk.

### Notes on Life

I am optimistic that better regulations in the private equity space can improve outcomes in subsequent downturns. 
Even outside PE, I believe most voters would support legislation that better protects society in our excessively financialized economy. 
Some ideas might include introducing regulations in the OTC derivatives market, upgrading capital buffer requirements, enhancing collateral management, and improving transparency and reporting in the nonbank lending sector.

I think the hyper capitalism of the past decade has contributed to significant disillusionment with the current system and the emergence of populism. 
Piketty argues that economic inequality is driven by the unequal distribution of wealth and income between capital and labor. 
If r > g where “r” represents the rate of return on capital and “g” represents the rate of economic growth, then a larger r – g gap leads to higher inequality and lower social mobility. 
While I have not thought too much about the role of a global tax on capital, a well-planned out consumption tax is an interesting idea. 

Even with the emergence of AI, the development of human capital starts with a strong education system. 
I think most people would agree on some basic tenets: allocate more time towards STEM based activities, don’t ban math, and expose all students to computer programming at a young age.
While perhaps in need of improvement, standardized tests are necessary to gauge performance. 
Students should also learn financial literacy skills.
Why shouldn't people have a practical understanding of the monetary system? 
In this way, individuals can make more informed decisions regarding spending and borrowing.

Differences in educational opportunities across races are another significant issue. The racial achievement gap is partly a reflection of unequal access to resources and has been found to exist before students even enter kindergarten. 
Lower-income school districts are more than twice as likely to have a funding gap compared to higher income districts (6). 
We should ensure better outcomes for equitable funding across school districts by reforming funding methods based largely on property taxes and by providing additional money for high-need districts.

Gender equality is an important concern, especially in emerging countries. 
In a 2021 keynote speech given in memory of Dr. Hansa Mehta, Gopinath explains that women were disproportionately affected by the pandemic as they tended to work in sectors that were hardest hit by lockdowns. 
In developing countries, women are “over-represented in the informal sector where they face lower pay, less job security and lower social protection”. 
Gopinath adds that, “55 percent of women are engaged in the labor market as opposed to 78 percent of men. 
In 72 countries, women are barred from opening bank accounts or obtaining credit. 
Women continue to earn about 50 percent less than men for the same type of work, and they represent only 25 percent of parliamentarians” (7). 
Fixing gender inequality is also channel through which we can add to national incomes. 

There is obviously a plethora of challenges from university leaders failing to call out blatant antisemitism to population growth. 
It is also frustrating to see people hanging onto the soft-landing narrative given its low likelihood and the unfathomable size of the bubble.
I have come to understand that there is only so much time in the day to spend working on thought-provoking problems. 
It is easy to take for granted all the information at our fingertips. 
While the world may be entering a dark period, I am hopeful that the U.S. and other countries can work to restore trust in institutions by holding people accountable for their actions. 
To put things in perspective, I remind myself that humanity is just a speck in the universe during some infinitesimal point in time.
