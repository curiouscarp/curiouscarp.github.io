### Markets

The 30-year yield is back above 4.5%. 
The SP500 is up from 4,950 in mid-April to nearly 5,500 today. 
Bitcoin has also been displaying strong results in recent months up from 40,000 at the end of January to now 63,000. 
The Nasdaq is up from April lows of 15,300 to now 17,840.
Gold has been above 2,000 for 2024.
The VIX has been low for pretty much the entire year. 
VIX futures also do not look to be priced for much volatility ahead which could be another way to hedge downside risk in markets if you believe a recession is coming.
Core PCE y/y for the month of May was 2.6% whereas it was 4.7% last May. 
The Fed tightening has had a positive effect as also evidenced by the 1 year inflation expectations.

I recently learned about the German Italian (BTP bund) spread. 
Germany is a benchmark in Europe for economic and political stability. 
Italy is considered a riskier country with higher political uncertainty and more debt. 
The IMF recently issued a warning about Italy where public debt is expected to rise to nearly 145% of GDP (2). 
The premium on Italian bonds is only about 1.5%. 
In a recession scenario, I would expect the spread to widen. 
For example, during COVID the spread went to over 2.5%.

### Emerging Signs of Economic Weakness? 

Japanese economic growth has begun to slow as evidenced by the recent GDP contraction. 
The downward revision to 2.9% came from changes in construction activity (3). 
Maybe they won’t tighten policy anytime soon. 
Argentina is now in a technical recession through austerity under Milei (4). 
The jobless rate is up to 7.7% in the first quarter. 
Construction jobs have taken a hard hit. 
Beef consumption in March had the sharpest drop in 30 years according to the Argentine Chamber of Meats and Derivatives Industry and Commerce. 

In the United States, pending home sales slipped 2.1%. 
Demand is dropping and housing inventory is rising. 
A 30-year fixed is about 7.5% right now. 
People with cushy rates from the pandemic are less likely to sell and buyers probably don’t like high rates. 
Additionally, the ISM new manufacturing orders fell below 50 points in May. 
On the labor side of things, the 4-week moving average of initial claims is at 236,000. 
While the number is higher than the lows of January (200,000) we are still nowhere near recession levels. 
For example, during April 2020 the figure was a whopping 5.3 million. 

News sentiment for the U.S. economy has also soured in recent months. 
For example, two a quick search on U.S. recession yields many articles and videos about the upcoming slowdown. 
Peter Berezin from BCA research notes that the reason the U.S. avoided a recession in 2022 and 2023 was due to the steepness of the Phillips curve. 
Thus, we saw an “immaculate disinflation” (5). 
However, he notes that the economy could fall into recession in late 2024 or early 2025.

### Other Interesting Items

The notional value of derivatives represents how much value a contract controls. 
A call that controls 100 shares of stock when the underlying spot price is $100 indicates a $10,000 notional value.
I believe the same concept applies with futures. 
For example, a contract that controls 10 bushels of wheat where wheat is $50 represents $500 in notional value. 
Posting some intial margin allows for greater capital efficiency.  

The basis trade involves a party buying a cash treasury and going short an underlying future in hopes of convergence (6). 
While the difference between cash bonds and futures could be small, hedge funds deploy leverage in the repo market.
Mutual funds might fund long treasury futures positions to track an index at a lower cost. 
During Covid we saw a large discrepancy between on the run and off the treasuries (analogous to the BTP bund spreads). 
Cash bonds underperformed and the rapid unwind to repay loans contributed to volatility.
The Fed stepped in to normalize conditions by provding emergency funding. 

A recent article from the Federal Reserve notes that CFTC short treasury futures might not provide adequate insight into basis trading activity (7). 
They instead consider SEC forms and FINRA trace data while noting the drawbacks of each method. 
In particular, the "cash-future basis trade returned to prominence in 2023". 
However leveraged fund futures positions alone likely "overestimate basis trade volume". 
By mid-January 2024, they find the "TRACE proxy suggests basis trade volumes of approximately $317 billion".
