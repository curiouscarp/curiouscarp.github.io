So, I’ve widened out the signal which makes way more sense in hindsight. 
I use the adjusted close prices to account for dividends and share splits. 
The dataset I built uses three-year percent changes from the latest quarterly earnings report. 
For example, Apple had an earnings release May 2nd, 2024. 
The annualized vol adjusted close from 3 years ago is about 124%.
For the features I’ll look at how much quarterly total revenue grew over the 3 years, for example. 

Since there is a single time window with the new approach, macro variables would account for little variation across samples. 
I trained the data on a sample of 410 stocks in the SP500. 
For the machine learning I use XGBoost with 5 folds for cross validation. 
I use a grid search for the learning rate, subsample, and maxdepth.
