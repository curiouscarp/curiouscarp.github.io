I previously considered some the early 2021 market activity.
In this post, I look at more definitive data from barchart to analyze unusual options activity.
The data can be found in the PostReferences folder. 
We know that by the end of 1/4/2021 short interest was about 263 million shares or about 290% of the float and the week ending 2/8/2021 the short interest was about 70 million or 87% of the float (Yahoo Finance). 
Say that is about 190 million shares. 

Figure 1: Calls from January 1 to February 4, 2021.

The total open interest for these calls is about 630,174. 
The $800 strikes are a bit of an outlier.
A lot of the $800 strikes also had very low DTEs.
For example, the open interest on 02/02/21 for $800 strikes was 10,465 while IV was at a staggering ~900%.
They could be a hedge or speculative. 
On February 2nd we saw significant volatility and upward price action at the same time a lot of $800 calls were opened.
Moreover, we saw a similar pattern on February 25th and March 10th during congruent market behavior. 

As per short covering, let's consider the deep in the money (DITM) calls.
They have a delta close to 1. 
However, you'd still be paying at least full price to cover the shares (not paying much theta premium), so I am not sure what the incentive is.

Interestingly, the total open interest for these calls is about 65,085 (nowhere near the 1.1 million number from Reddit unless there is missing data).
Only roughly 10% of the OI were deep in the money.
A lot of the OI had ATM or slighly ITM calls.
95% of the ITM calls came after January 20th.
By the 18th the short interest was only about 164 million shares or a reduction of 100 million shares.
Thus, the overall short reduction cannot be accounted for by simply ITM calls.
It is possible they were used to reset FTDs.

I found some option flow from March 2021 via UnusualWhales. While the sizes aren’t massive, it is highly bizarre to see institutions spending such large premium on the options. It is possible that they added to a gamma squeeze if a counterparty bought shares to hedge.

I believe it also makes sense to analyze Jan, Feb, and March 2021 put open interest given the highly unusual distance from the mean as seen in figure 5, likely contributing to the shape of the curve in 5b. 
Assume independence through time for simplicity.

The chain does include several deeply out of the money puts at the below $2 mark. 
For example, these are highly unusual:
![DOOMP](/assets/images/DOOMP.png)

We saw a total of 575,506 of put open interest (from barchart’s ‘unusual options activity’) in those dates.
81% of the total came after January 20th. 
The contracts may have been used to deal with hiding a short position instead of some CDSs as a "bankruptcy" hedge.

From 13F filings we know Melvin Capital had 6,000,000 shares worth of puts ending Q4 2020.
Married puts are speculated to be a loophole for locates by manipulating net positioning.
Buying put contracts (not too far OTM) from MMs also exerts downward price pressure given delta hedging. 

According to 13F data from 13f.info, Susquehanna held 4.8 million shares worth of puts, 1.8 million shares worth of calls, and 2.4 million shares ending Q4 2020. 
Ending Q1 2021, Susquehanna held 6.2 million shares worth of puts, 3.5 million shares worth of calls, and 146,000 shares. 
For Citadel Advisors, the Q4 2020 figure is 2.2 million shares worth of puts, 1.7 million shares worth of calls, and 217,000 shares. 
In the next quarter, Citadel's figures are 3.2 million shares worth of puts, 2.2 million shares worth of calls, and 22,000 shares. 
It is very interesting that total option positions increased despite the sharp reduction in short interest over the quarter. 
Keep in mind 13Fs don't show short positions or intraquarter activity.

I believe a more thorough understanding of SBF's tokenized liquidity could shed light on the January (and subsequent) price action.
It is possible that the token swap patterns in late January helped to reduce FTDs.
It would also be interesting to consider correlations between shorted ETFs like XRT or IWM and borrowable shares for shorting the underlying constituents.
Increased buying pressure on ETFs allows APs to sell ETFs that do not exist. 
There is also a create-to-lend mechanism. 
It is possible that some covering in addition to ETF manipulation could have contributed to the SI% reduction. 
Citadel Advisors and Susquehanna have some of the largest XRT positions as of November of 2023.

I believe IWM was one of the main ETFs used for shorting until the rebalance, so let's take a quick look.

Figure 7b: IWM SI estimate

IWM short interest percentage appears to have increased between the January 2021 and July 2021 period.
Once the ETF has been created or borrowed, it can be opened via in-kind redemption to access the underlyings.
As per dealing with FTDs, the answer is less clear. 
It is possible that "hard to find" underlyings were just replaced with cash.
This analysis can be iterated upon by looking at all the ETFs containing a targeted underlying in some time period and considering the CTB/FTDs/Price behavior.

We can also observe the differences in 13F filing data for IWM between Q42020 and Q12021 (figure 8). 
Across the board, shares counts increased at Susquehanna, Citadel, Credit Suisse, and Bank of America. 
Bank of America had the largest increase on an absolute basis.
