William Sharpe proposed the binomial model as a numerical method to price options. 
It is more accurate than the closed form Black-Scholes method over long contract periods and 
uses a time discrete mechanism to discount option payoffs over some specified period 
using underlying stock price, strike price, volatility, time until expiry and the risk-free rate. 
It is also pretty straightforward to understand. 
However, the computation is slow and memory intensive.

In C++, I use a pointer to a pointer to a node to navigate the tree structure as a private member. 
The node struct contains: 

````
struct Node{
	double stock_price,exercise_value,payoff_value,
        alive_value,final_value, time;
};
````

In the constructor I create the tree using:

````
tree = new Node* [height];
for(int i = 0; i<height; ++i){
	tree[i] = new Node [i + 1];
}
````

The calculation of intrinsic value is trivial at any point in time. For calls, the result is 0 or (the stock price at time t – the strike) and for puts the value at time T is (the strike – the stock price at time t) or 0. Intuitively, this depends on the whether the option is in the money or not. 

To calculate St, the stock price at time t, the model utilizes two possible outcomes for each iteration. 
Either there is a move up with some probability p or move down with probability 1-p. 
We also have multiplicative factors for up and down movements. 
Given volatility, risk-free rate, and the timestep solve for the multiplicative factors, up and down,
and then the artificial value for p. In C++ using a common formula:

````
double up = exp(vol*sqrt(step));
double down = exp(-1 * vol * sqrt(step));

double p = (exp(rrf*step) - down) / (up - down);
````

After having these values, we just populate by iterating through the tree and calculate each intrinsic value depending on whether we have a put or a call by going forward in time. 
I denote these values in the struct using payoff_value. 
The tree ends up looking something like this showing the stock_price value in each node:

Options also have some extrinsic value. As time until maturity decreases, the probability of 
expiration in the money decreases. 
This also depends on the risk-free rate and volatility. 
Let’s assume these to be constant for simplicity. 
The last “column” in the tree has no extrinsic value for obvious reasons. 
Thus, we can simply go backward in time for deriving the time value for all the nodes in each previous period.
I denote these in the struct using alive_value. 

Starting at the period t-1 where t is the time at expiry, I calculate alive values and select the maximum of the payoffs and the alives denoted in final value: 

````
for(int i = height-2; i>=0; --i){
	  for(uint32_t j = 0; j<=i; ++j){
    
	    tree[i][j].alive_value = (1/(1+rrf))*(p*tree[i+1][j].final_value + (1-p)
	    *tree[i+1][j+1].final_value);
      
	    tree[i][j].final_value = max(tree[i][j].alive_value,tree[i]
	    [j].exercise_value);
	}
}
````

While a fun project, the memory usage is quite high given the two-degree pointer structure. 
This was the first solution that came to mind. 
A traditional binary tree implementation might use extra nodes for equivalent underlying prices since movements with the same total number of up and down movements are not distinct at any point in time, but there may be ways around this. I also used exercise_value to store 0 or the positive intrinsic value which is unnecessary.
Calculation time is also Θ(n^2) which can be quite slow for large trees. 
Find the project on my Github, curiouscarp. 
It also includes a Black-Scholes model for comparison and a python script to play around with visualization.
