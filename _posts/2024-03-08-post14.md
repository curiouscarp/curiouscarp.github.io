### Intro

XRT is a very strange ETF. A red flag comes up in 13F filings. 
According to Fintel, institutions have claims on about 26M shares. 
There are only about 5M XRT shares outstanding.
I am not sure what the auditors have been doing for the past decade. 

The relative stability in net outstanding shares is interesting given the excess claims. 
Either shares are getting redeemed as fast as they are created, or gross creations are not taking place. 
We know that APs typically buy underlying securities to create an ETF when the ETF price exceeds the NAV, so I believe gross creation takes place.
We also know from the SPDR Statement of Additional Information that “deposit securities” get combined with a “cash component” to form a creation basket. 
However, the trust “reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of a ‘cash in lieu’ amount to be added to the cash component to replace any deposit security.”
It is possible that ETFs representing a full basket of securities are getting created with missing securities so that APs are short the missing securities (figure 1). 
The owner of the ETF would also have an ETF representing a full basket.

There are different ways to establish a synthetic short position using an ETF. 
A short fund can borrow the ETF from a lending institution. 
Another way is via the “create-to-borrow” mechanism, in which a broker borrows the underlyings to turn into the AP in exchange for an ETF. 
Li and Zhu explain that “stocks which are heavily shorted via ETFs have significantly lower hedge fund ownership, suggesting that the measure does reflect the bearish view of sophisticated investors.” 
Moreover, “ETF short interest is high when the lendable supply of underlying constituents is low and the cost of shorting the underlying stocks is high.” 

To get a better idea of magnitude, ORTEX estimates a current short interest of about 20M shares. 
If an illiquid underlying began to rapidly appreciate, the ETF’s NAV would increase and exert upward price pressure on the ETF on the secondary market. 
I believe a squeeze on the ETF could occur if the creation mechanism is unable to function properly.

We know that the NSCC processes ETF creations and redemptions using an instruction detail file (1). 
They also clear ETF trades on the secondary market. 
The website mentions that the DTCC “provides clearance and settlement of the ETF, as well as the underlying components, through the NSCC’s CNS and Non-CNS settlement process. 
When eligible, settlement of the underlying components of ETFs and certain eligible ETFs through CNS are guaranteed by NSCC.” 
Moreover, members can “create or redeem a customized standard portfolio by substituting the underlying components with cash, or by replacing those components with other securities that are eligible to be processed at NSCC.”

### FTDs

Though just a small part of overall volume, failures to deliver are interesting (figure 2). 
FTDs can occur from the bona fide market making process via operational shorting, or short institutions.
Failure to settle the transaction after the standard T+2 period results in an FTD. 
Bona fide market makers get an extra three days to cover fails to enhance liquidity. 
Admittedly, I thought the impact from FTDs was larger until I realized how ETFs work.

### Dark Pools

It is interesting that 3-4 synthetics for every real share can get sold without more fails. 
Chart exchange reveals that 30-40% of daily XRT trade volume occurs off exchange including in dark pools. 
These pools generally limit price discovery since orders do not show on standard level 2 data feeds. 
Say an institution wants to move a lot of shares. 
A trader can go to a dark pool using a VWAP algorithm to spread the impact over the day, making the transaction less detectable.

Given the hundreds of thousands of shares a day on the dark pool, it looks like synthetics (claims on air) are traded back and forth. 
It is impossible for all the short sales to be matched with a given long sale. 
There is an illusion of real market activity, a fugazi of sorts.

### Options

I found interesting put/call OI patterns before large opex events (figure 5). 
March 18th, 2022 was an options expiry day. 
On March 11th, the March 18th option chain shows 205,000 puts expiring at various strike prices. 
March OpEx was the 17th in 2023 with about 170,000 XRT puts expiring.

Given elevated put/call OI I started looking at option flow data. I found a number of interesting put transactions with large premium (relative to the other trades).

Considering put volumes over time, there are a couple of possibilities. Sellers of puts get assigned shares if they go ITM, allowing them to be used as a locates. Rolling puts can represent activity to cover short positions on a continuous basis. Additionally, options contracts are used by dealers for hedging.

I have been watching the option chains on market chameleon for the next few expiries and they tend to become more populated over time as older puts expire. March 24th has over 120,000 put OI whereas a few weeks ago the figure was 100,000. Looking at flow from February 13th reveals that a significant volume was traded for March 15th expiry and some with a very low DTE (expiring the same week).

### More Macro

It looks like some dominos are starting to fall including Japan, the U.K., and nearly Germany.
Surprise surprise. 
It is quite remarkable to see the resilience of the U.S. economy considering the large, quick interest rate hikes. 
Aside from the strong labor market, the prevalence of the fixed rate mortgage likely reduces some of the direct impact from the rate hikes. 
Unless we get some hedge funds blowing up, the economy looks fine as far as I can tell.
El-Erian among other economists have recently re-emphasized the risks in commercial real estate. 

Heightened volatility sometime after the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) ends on March 11th may lead to night sweats for some banks. 
The BTFP allows banks to post collateral that are valued at par for loans up to one year in length (2). 
The emergency lending program started last March after the SVB and Signature Bank failures.
Whether or not we get a new program to alleviate the pressure on banks is unclear.

On a side note, commodities tend to be a channel through which deflationary pressures transmit. 
I am not a commodities expert by any means, but the recent run up in cocoa and orange juice futures does not look sustainable.
