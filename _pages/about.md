# **ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,**\**I'm Zach Gruber.**

## Thanks for stopping by.

I am an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University studying economics and computer science with a minor in applied math. 

This website is designed to be a contemplative journal to share some of my latest thoughts. My current plan is to post biweekly starting September on topics I find fascinating including selections from macroeconomics, computer science, art, food, fitness, among others. Stay tuned :)
