ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I am an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University studying computer science and economics with a minor in math. 

This website is designed to be a contemplative journal of sorts. My plan is to get some biweekly posts going soon on topics I find fascinating including selections from econmics, computer science, art, food, and fitness. Stay tuned :)
